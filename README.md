**Five Practices of the Sincere Developer**



1. Communicate often, letting go of worries of _wrong_, _late_, _failure_, etc.
2. Complete a task at least once per hour. If unsure going into the hour then split the task.
3. Strive for full branch coverage, resilient to code mutations.
4. Focus on _Single Responsibility Principle_; inject responsibilities via composition.
5. Work on exactly what is needed now and nothing else. Never predict what could be needed.

And bonus practice…



6. Continuously note progress. This practice helps sustain the other practices.
